        <p> Hi! My name is.... psyche. Since I am not a professional yet this page is gonna be empty for a while to save my self-esteem from utter destruction. Don't worry though! You can have lots of fun looking at the <a href="myportfolio.html">portfolio</a> section or the <a href="codinglibrary.html">libraries</a> section. Don't want to? Then you can finish reading this long and completely pointless yet entertaining whatever it is. I'll be sure to upload more about me in the future when I am more interesting. You're probably wondering how I could be possibly more interesting than I already am. You're also probably wondering how interesting I am to begin with since you don't know me. Well I can guarantee you this: all your questions will most probably be answered if you continuing visiting my site and checking for updates. I can also guarantee that I am not telling you this just to increase traffic on my webpage. Actually, I can't guarantee that. For those of you still reading this, I bet you must be very very very bored. Since you decided to dedicate your time to my webpage I will help you with your boredomness. You should watch this super cute kitten video because it is absolutely ADORABLE. Your Welcome.

        <p>I know you have a lot of reasons to thank me, but don't worry all of this is free of charge. If you're still bored, you should probably go program something right now. May the codes be in your favor.</p>
